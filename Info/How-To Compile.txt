This file has the goal to give you some information about the compilation process.

First of all this application is developped in C++ with Qt.

The initial developpment was made under windows vista. 

In this case you need to install Qt with the MinGW and to config the PATH ( See the Qt installation doc)

After this you need to use de Qt 4.4.x command prompt utilty to QMAKE the project.
(a good idea is to change the 'start in' directory of the Qt command prompt to avoid many loos of time)

Now you can do 

...> qmake -project
...> qmake MyPrestations.pro
...> make

The executable will be in the debug directory.
